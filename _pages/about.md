Telecommunication Engineer, and Ph. D. specialist in Big Data and Signal Processing Technologies from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (both with honors). During the Ph. D. I researched about the application of Signal Processing and Machine Learning into Internet of the things (IoT) with publications in international research journals of the field. Also, I have been lecturer at undergraduate and graduate level both in Spanish and English in different courses: Data Processing, Image Processing, Signals and Systems.

After, the Ph. D. I was as a postdoc in I3A (Instituto de Investigación en Ingeniería de Aragón) working in mathematical modeling of cardiac cells in BSICoS (Biomedical Signal Interpretation and Computational Simulation) group. 

Since 2019 I am Artificial Intelligence Engineer in NTTDATA (formerly Everis) where I coordinate the technical team in charge of the Artificial Intelligence of Knowler, an innovative product of smart knowledge management. 

I have professional experience in the use of machine learning and Natural Language Processing techniques and frameworks; in the design and implementation of intelligent information systems: e.g., Information extraction systems, Document Classifiers, Recommendation Systems, etc. Also I have proficiency in Python and professional Java and Big Data techniques experience.

I have Interest in all levels of Research, Development, Innovation and Competitive Intelligence.
